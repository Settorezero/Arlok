Arlok is the second version of [AR.L.O.](https://github.com/Cyb3rn0id/AR.L.O.) made to be compatible with the [MakerUNO](https://makeruno.com.my/) board.  

## Buy a PCB  
Making the PCB on PCBWay will support my work, but you need to subscribe to PCBWay first: you can do it using [my invite link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=355653&from=settorezero2020).  
The you can let you make the [PCB on PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ARLOK_arduino_robot.html)

## Print it by yourself!
In the [STL folder](./stl) are located all parts you can 3Dprint by yourself. An [exploded view](./media/arlok_3d_exploded.stl) shows how parts have to be placed.

## Code examples
See in the [Arduino folder](./arduino) for code examples
