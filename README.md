Arlok is a simple educational Robot based on Arduino Uno with parts printed in 3D and all easy-available components. 3D-printed parts are big, easy to manipulate and printed even by cheap 3D-printers. Arlok is highly customizable: you can change wheels and tires, supports, powering systems and give Arlok an expression too! Arlok is cheap, cute and easy to assemble and program. There are some programming examples that will make this robot moving around avoiding obstacles, following a line on the floor or let you control it using your cellphone with an Android app (source code of app provided too!).
