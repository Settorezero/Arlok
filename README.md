# Arlok
## Arduino Robot with MakerUNO - 3D-print it yourself!
![Arlok Front View](./media/arlokka_and_arlok.jpg)

ARLOK is a simple educational (STEM) Robot based on Arduino UNO with parts printed in 3D and all easy-available components.   
  
ARLOK is cheap, cute and easy to assemble and program. There are some programming examples that will make this robot moving around avoiding obstacles, following a line on the floor or let you control it using your cellphone.  
  
ARLOK is the second version of [AR.L.O.](https://github.com/Cyb3rn0id/AR.L.O.) made to be compatible with the [MakerUNO](https://makeruno.com.my/) board. So it's better use a MakerUNO but you can use also an Arduino UNO (in this case you'll need some longer headers for the shield connections).  

## Materials needed
- List of parts to be 3D-printed: [stl folder](./stl).  
- BOM in the docs folder: [Bill-Of-Materials](./docs/BOM.md).  

## Assembling
I've prepared a detailed step-by-step guide: it's located in the [docs folder](./docs/assembly.md).  
ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ For italian users: there is an [italian guide too](./docs/assembly_ita.md)  
If you've already analog servo, I've prepared also a [guide about servo hacking for continuos rotation](./docs/servo_mod.md)

## Code examples
See in the [Arduino folder](./arduino) for code examples or write your own using one of the provided example as base!

## Troubleshooting
See [Troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md)
