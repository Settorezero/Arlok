# Arlok  
## Arduino Robot with MakerUNO - 3D-print it yourself!
![Arlok Front View](./media/arlok_front_view_16_9.jpg)

ARLOK is a simple educational (STEM) Robot based on Arduino UNO with parts printed in 3D and all easy-available components.   
ARLOK is cheap, cute and easy to assemble and program.  There are some programming examples that will make ARLOK moving around avoiding obstacles, following a line on the floor or let you control your small robot using your cellphone.  
  
ARLOK is the second version of [AR.L.O.](https://github.com/Cyb3rn0id/AR.L.O.) made to be compatible with the [MakerUNO](https://makeruno.com.my/) board. So it's better use a MakerUNO but you can use also an Arduino UNO (in this case you'll need some longer headers for the shield connections). 

## What materials are needed?
The list of parts to be 3D-printed is in the [stl folder](./stl).  
The list of all other parts (BOM) is located in the docs folder: [Bill-Of-Materials](./docs/BOM.md).  

## Assembling instructions
I've prepared a detailed step-by-step guide: it's located in the [docs folder](./docs/assembly.md)

## Code examples
See in the [Arduino folder](./arduino) for code examples or write your own using one of the provided example as base!
