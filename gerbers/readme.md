# Arlok PCB Gerbers (REV 1)
  
This folder contains gerber files for lastest version (REV1) PCB manufacturing. You can preview them using a free Gerber Viewer such as [GerbV](http://gerbv.geda-project.org/).  
I advice you to let PCBWay make the PCBs for you since they already have those files, without the need for you to upload and set an order.
